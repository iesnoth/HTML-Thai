Consider the following questions:

What does a user want when they visit a restaurant's website?
    To find the menu and prices easily, in an easy to read format. If it's a food most people don't know, descriptions and pictures are a plus.
How long does a user want to spend on the site?
    Only as long as it takes to figure out what to order. If they do want to explore the site, the paths through the site should be clear and easy to access.
What information is the most important visually?
    Heading, navbar, text (on the menu especially)
Have you ever visited a restaurant website? If so, was there any part of the experience that either frustrated or delighted you?
    I'm always happy when I can order direct from the website. I don't like delivery services, and it's easiest when I can order online instead of calling.
    I also like when menus are separated into categories and lists are itemized in an easy to read way.
    I'm frustrated when the prices aren't obvious, or the text is too small or the color scheme makes it hard to read.
