        <p>
            With humble beginnings in a small town in Missouri, H-Thai-ML started its journey as a bad pun Piyapon Saejung's mom made when bringing him traditional Thai snacks while he was coding.
            Since his asperations of developing an AI which could go to social engagements for him wasn't going anywhere, Piyapon put his coding knowledge to more effective use by building a website to promote his mother's vibrant vittles.
            The company took off and soon expanded, finding the most success in tiny towns in need of a bit of diversity. In the five years since they opened their flagship location in Sedalia, MO, the Saejungs have opened 3 more locations, and will soon franchise with the number of locations set to skyrocket in the next two years.
            But most importantly, now that Piyapon is rich and his restaurant franchised and handed off to more ambitious businessmen, the young Thai entrepeneur no longer has to attend social events.
